# **Reliable Latent-Tree Clustering under Static and Drifting Distributions**
Version 1.0 (Work in Progress)

Official implementation of the paper "Reliable Latent-Tree Clustering under Static and Drifting Distributions".

## Overview

This project implements algorithms for dynamic and static structural/parameter estimation, along with clustering, for three data types:
1.Tree-structured data generated by latent tree models;
2.Synthetic data from Gaussian Mixture Models (GMM);
3.Real-world datasets from various domains.

#### 1.tree_structure_data.py
This project implements latent variable-based clustering analysis, true label generation, and evaluation processes for tree structure data. It is designed to infer the distribution of latent variables from observed data and perform clustering analysis based on these variables (Table1, 2, 7, 8, 10, 11, 15, and 16 in the paper. Table8, 9, 16, 17 in the supplement).
#### 2.GMM_data.py
This project implements a complete workflow for data generation using a  GMM, including structure learning, parameter estimation, and clustering analysis based on information distance (Table 2, 9, 11 and 17 in the paper. Table 7, 15 in the supplement).
#### 3.real_world_data.py
This code implements real data clustering analysis based on multiple clustering algorithms and evaluates the clustering results using internal and external metrics. The code supports preprocessing, feature extraction, and repeated experiments on different data types, and finally saves the clustering results and evaluation metrics to CSV files.(Tables 3, 5, 6, 12, 13 and 14 in the paper. Table2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 10, 11, 12, 13 and 14 in the supplement).
#### 4.driftingPE_tree_structure_data.py
This code is an online learning tool for graphical models, with core functions including: defining the model structure (observed/latent nodes and parent node relationships), generating incremental data (initial generation + subsequent reuse of old data and merging with newly generated data), calculating information distance based on observed data and learning the graphical structure (using the SLLT algorithm), performing online parameter estimation of the model, inferring marginal probabilities of latent variables, and conducting clustering analysis by integrating data and model structure. (The corresponding content is presented in Figure 3 of the main text and Figures 5, 6, and 7 in the Appendix.)
#### 5.driftingSL_tree_structure_data.py
Realize structural evolution. The structures are estimated using two methods: batch-wise EMA tracking (dynamic learning) and the current batch sample (static learning). Perform clustering and save the evaluation metrics. (This corresponds to Section 4 of the Supplementary Materials: Structural Evolution.)
#### 6.DMICC_implementation.py
This project proposes a self-supervised contrastive learning framework for tabular data, using an MLP backbone and multiple loss functions (ID, FMI, and cross-view contrastive loss). It aims to learn discriminative representations from labeled CSV data and evaluate clustering performance via a non-parametric classifier and metrics like NMI, ARI, and ACC (Tables 5–9, 12–17 in the paper; Tables 2–17 in the supplement).
